  qtnx: A Qt-based NX client linking to nxcl

  George Wright. January 2008. gwright@kde.org

This is an update of the experimental QtNX client which was based on the
now deprecated NXClientLib backend library. This is an experimental port
to Seb James' nxcl library.

Building qtnx
-------------

Prerequisites are:

* libXcomp from NoMachine, provided by the nxcomp package.
* nxssh from NoMachine
* nxproxy from NoMachine
* nxcl from the FreeNX subversion repository

(These three NX components all should be from the 3.x.x series. You can
obtain them from NoMachine's servers at http://www.nomachine.com/sources.php)

Read the nxcl README for details of the first three packages. You will not need
to build the nxcmd daemon nor the doxygen API documentation.

To build QtNX you will need Qt 4.x. You need to run the following commands:

$ qmake
$ make

This will generate a qtnx binary in that directory; install it to /usr/bin
or anywhere you want.

Win32 Builds
------------

In order to build on Win32, you will need a full Cygwin setup. Ensure you have
pkg-config installed in cygwin.

Build Qt 4.3.3 as per the instructions on http://wiki.lyx.org/LyX/LyXOnCygwin;
you will, however, need to patch Qt. Line 528 in src/corelib/codecs/qtextcodec.cpp
should also contain an extra conditional:

&& !defined(Q_CYGWIN_WIN)

You can then build Qt without any trouble by following those instructions. Ensure
you also build the XML module and install qmake and mkspecs.

Afterwards, set QTDIR to point to wherever you installed Qt to, and set the
PATH to point to QTDIR/bin as well:

$ export QTDIR=/usr/local/src/qtwin-4.3.3
$ export PATH=$QTDIR/bin:$PATH

You can then build qtnx normally with the standard steps:

$ qmake
$ make

Mac OS X Builds
---------------

Ensure that you have a build of Qt 4 on OS X, then run qmake from $QTDIR/bin.

Standard procedure then follows:

$ qmake
$ make

You can then put statically linked versions of nxssh and nxproxy and id.key in
qtnx.app/Contents/MacOS - it should then all just work.
